<p>I built model airplanes as a 12yr old, only kid in my family that liked airplanes. I started to fly gliders at 14yrs of age and my first solo was in a glider at age 15 at the Great Western Soaring School in Pearblossom, CA &#8211; near Palmdale. I started flying powered airplanes at age 16 and received my private pilot certificate out of Van Nuys airport with DPE Adam Berg.</p>
<p>I continued working and studying for my commercial and finally received my flight instructor certificate out of the Long Beach FAA FSDO in 1973. From then on I instructed for a living and flew for charter and smaller airlines. In 1990, I went to work for Eastern Airlines as a first officer in a Boeing 727.</p>
<p>I now have about 17,000 hours, 2700 multi-engine, tail wheel instructor, basic aerobatic instructor and also earned my A&amp;P Certificate (FAA Licensed Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic).</p>
<p>You can find me out at the Hemet-Ryan Airfield where I serve as the Chief Flight Instructor of the <a href="http://flyhemet.com">Hemet Ryan Flight School</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:embirdman@yahoo.com">embirdman@yahoo.com</a> or 951.663.0668.</strong></p>

<p>1. Your instructor should schedule your checkride with me. I can give him a few tips over the phone at that time. Plan a four hour block of time for your checkride. 2.0 on the ground and 1.2 in flight. 0.8 for paperwork. Bring a snack lunch.</p>
<p>2. IACRA &#8211; (Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application) You and Your instructor will need to register and get an FTN # (FAA Tracking Number). Write down your username, password, and FTN # in your logbook.</p>
<p>3. fill out application form (8710-1) at least 2 days prior to checkride with your instructor. Be very careful with the following:<br />
	1. Use full legal name &#8211; it should match your Student Pilot Certificate.<br />
	2. You must hold a Pilot Certificate &#8211; Student or higher.<br />
	3. Print the Medical Examiner&#8217;s name exactly as shown with M.D or D.O.<br />
	4. List ALL PIC hours (Pilot in Command). SOLO hours are shown BOTH as Solo Time and PIC.<br />
	5. Dual time plus solo time should equal total time.</p>
<p>4. Give me a call 2 days prior to your checkride with your FTN #.</p>
<p>5. Use the Applicant Practical Test Checklist provided in the PTS (Practical Test Standards). Review this with your instructor.</p>
<p>6. Double check required endorsements, including FAR 61.39a6, or 61.49 if a retest. Also, FAR 61.107a, Logged GROUND and Flight training in areas of operation that apply to the aircraft category and class rating sought. For Private ASEL, FAR 61.107b1(i thru xii).</p>
<p>7. Flight Instructors that have a temporary certificate (recently issued) may not be in the IACRA database. In this case, fill out a paper 8710-1, except sport pilots use 8710-11. Make sure all dates are 8 digit including instructors expiration date.</p>
<p>8. Always bring a current picture ID&#8230;a current driver&#8217;s license, Military ID, or a current Passport., current knowledge test report and of course your logbook.</p>
<p>9. Fee. $500 Cash Please. Retest is $300-500 depending on scope of retest required.</p>
